## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
it is the accuracy of the prediction. It says how close your prediction was to the actual value.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
136.5
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
blood pressure is different from person to person based off of many differnt variables. The predictions was also not very close to the actual value
