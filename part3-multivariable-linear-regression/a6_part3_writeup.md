## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
it is the accuracy of the model on a zero to one scale. my coefficent was 0.86
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
yes because the R^2 is pretty accurate
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
