It also shows the training data to get a better understanding of the predictions

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
how close the computers prediciton was to the training data

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
it is much more accurate because the R squared value is closer to 1.
